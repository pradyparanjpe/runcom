# RUNCOM backup
This directory contains a backup of configuration that existed before runcom was setup.
Files in this directory may be merged to their respective place after inspection.
A corresponding entry should be added to the `RUNCOMDIR/dotfiles/.stow-local-ignore`.
I recommend that this directory should **NOT** be deleted.
It will be required to undo the setup.

See [Runcom setup](https://pradyparanjpe.github.io/runcom/setup.html).
